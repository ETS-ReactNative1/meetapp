# Challenge 02. Starting application

Create an application from scratch using Express.

In this application configure the following tools:

- Sucrase + Nodemon;
- ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig;
- Sequelize (Use PostgreSQL or MySQL);

During this challenge we will start a new project in Bootcamp, this project will be developed gradually until the end of our journey where we will have a complete application involving back-end, front-end and mobile.

This project will also be used for bootcamp certification, so let's go code!

## Application

The application we will start development from now on is a developer event aggregator called Meetapp (an acronym for Meetup + App).

In this first challenge we will create some basic functionalities that we have learned throughout the classes up to here.

## Functionalities

Below are the features we should add to our application.

### Authentication

Allow a user to authenticate to our application using email and password.

- Authentication must be developed using JWT.
- Perform validation of the input data;

### User registration and update

Allow new users to sign up for our application using their name, email, and password.

To update the password, the user must also send a confirmation field with the same password.

- Encrypt the user's password for security.
- Perform validation of the input data;

## Submit

This challenge does not need to be submited and we will not receive a correction, but we can see the result of the challenge code here: https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-02

"Do not wait to plant, just have the patience to harvest"!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Installing

To download the project follow the instructions bellow:

```
1. git clone https://github.com/diegomais/rocketseat-bootcamp-gostack-desafio-02.git
2. cd rocketseat-bootcamp-gostack-desafio-02
```

Then install dependencies and run:

```
3. yarn install
4. yarn run dev
```

or
